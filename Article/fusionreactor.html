                    <strong>Scientists Presented Fusion Reactor That Shocks The Entire Industry!

                    </strong>
                    <p>The chinese experimental reactor east is known as the artificial sun it's called that because in
                        2022. The team of scientists working on it came close to creating a source of ultimate clean
                        energy called thermonuclear fusion it's the same reaction that's kept our sun shining for
                        billions of years it can also put an end to oil and coal consumption and even stop climate
                        change, but in this blog we will find out Why can the Construction of the most expensive fusion
                        reactor fail?Why does humanity have very little time to study a new fusion method and Why should
                        we think twice before switching to fusion power?


                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <strong>How did Scientists even manage to create an Artificial star?


                    </strong>
                    <p>The pressure in the nucleus of our Sun reaches 260 billion atmospheres for comparison diamonds
                        are formed out of carbon at a pressure of only 55,000 atmospheres as a result of fusion on the
                        sun deutrium and tritium nuclei merge with each other releasing a tremendous amount of energy
                        unfortunately it's simply impossible to recreate solar pressure here on earth.
                        .</p>
                    <p> But scientists found a way around that in the east reactor they heated up nuclear fuel to
                        temperatures many times higher than solar ones up to 100 million degrees celsius for reaction
                        not to be interrupted and the plasma not to burn the reactor along with the scientist it's kept
                        together by a very powerful magnetic field at the beginning of 2022 the east reactor managed to
                        maintain the right conditions for thermonuclear fusion for a record 17 and a half minutes this
                        is a huge breakthrough but so far the reactor is more like a car that you can start for a moment
                        but it's simply not possible to drive it yet. Meanwhile 35 countries invested 20 billion euros
                        in constructing the eater fusion reactor which will be larger and more powerful than east for
                        the record that's nearly all of nasa's budget. If they can finally get more energy from eater
                        than they spend on heating the plasma and maintaining the magnetic fields then in 2040
                        scientists plan to launch the first ever demo power plant with a thermonuclear reactor but the
                        whole project is also criticized for being too technically complex and unreasonably expensive
                        howere we still need new safe sources of energy.

                        <strong>Why do People die from fossil fuels?


                        </strong>
                        <p>Why is burning fossil fuels literally killing us right now for city folk all energy is in
                            sockets but 90% of this energy comes from coal, oil and gas. When coal is burned soot micro
                            particles reach the air they can get into our lungs and cause thrombosis, strokes and even
                            heart attacks in fact hundreds of thousands of people die from fossil fuel burning products
                            every year and over 10 years coal-fired power stations emmit 55,000 tons of uranium adn
                            thorium impurities into the atmosphere this is more than all the spent nuclear fuel in the
                            world and if coal seems outdated to you what about kerosene lamps half a billion people
                            still use them to light their homes 77 billion liters of kerosene are burned in lamps every
                            year well its smoke poisons tens of thousands of people but this fuel is still relatively
                            clean compared to your usual firewood that's right while we're asking alexa to microwave the
                            toast millions of people are still cooking food on wood and fires.


                        </p>
                        <p>Fires and carbon monoxide take another 3 million lives every year but no matter what we do
                            atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions are growing steadily over the past 100 years. They've
                            increased by one and a half times the problem will be solved once we switch to thermonuclear
                            power plants that will only emit harmless helium as a byproduct but it'll take 20 years
                            before you can finally charge your phone from a fusion energy socket and we need to do
                            something about it now and there might just be another thing that can save us .

                        <strong> What Can Replace Fusion Energy?



                        </strong>
                        <p>What energy sources can replace thermoclear fusion in just an hour the sun could give us our
                            annual energy supply but solar panels are almost useless in cloudy weather and at night
                            besides to get enough energy we need entire fields of them and batteries tend to wear out
                            and lose their efficiency.

                        </p>
                        <p> Wind turbines are also not a very good option they're expensive to build manitain birds die
                            because of them and if it's not windy outside you won't even be able to charge your phone
                            but there is another quite unusual source that's often forgotten I'm talking about
                            geothermal power plants that use the earth's internal energy even just 1% of the energy from
                            the earth's crust is 500 times more than what we could get from burning all the oil and gas
                            in the world but here's the problem drilling wells in seismically active areas leads to new
                            cracks in the crust provoking potential earthquakes in general the primary concern of
                            alternative energy sources is that their efficiency highly depends on natural conditions.

                        </p>
                        <p>So does this mean that only thermonuclear fusion will help us escape the suffocating embrace
                            of coal and gas and which might only be possible in 20 years, luckily there is a way out and
                            it's not in the fusion of nuclei but in their well-known division.

                        <p>Why can nuclear energy be more efficient than the fusion kind.


                        </p>
                        <p>Nuclear energy is really badly promoted when people hear chernobyl or fukushima they don't
                            think about a bright future but about that bottle of iodine pills sitting at home what if
                            it's just this fear that prevents us from adequately appreciating the benefits of nuclear
                            power well if we consider the most curcial point performance the fusion method has the upper
                            hand a fusion reactor produces 4 times more energy than a nuclear one from a kilogram of
                            fuel that's one to zero for fusion in terms of fuel deutrium and tritium can be found in
                            seawater which is in abundance on earth but at the same time there's also more than enough
                            uranium is used by nuclear power plants to operate them for quite some times the score is 2
                            to 1 next the waste from thermonuclear power plants is dangerous for the next 150 years in
                            contrast nuclear waste products decompose in 500 years now score 3 to 1 for fusion team but
                            in defense of nuclear energy its waste can at least be reused but what about their safety
                            the fusion reactors is highly valued for its automatic shutdown mechanism in case of the
                            slightest mishap however today's nuclear reactors also have such technology besides it was
                            the human factor that played a critical role in all those terrible nuclear accidents of the
                            past each team gets 1 point here in the final round we'll talk about the benifits with all
                            its advantages the fusion method has two main flaws reactors are costly and there's a high
                            risk of a breakdown because they're really complicated in its nuclear power isn't as
                            expensive as it used to be and it's also much easier to maintain but the most important
                            thing is that the nuclear power plant infrastructure already exists whereas it'll take 20
                            years to reach mass thermonuclear energy and given all the technical and finencial
                            challenges it might forever stay 20 years away from us and here is the crucial difference it
                            should be pointed out that right now good old nuclear energy definitely outdoes trendy
                            thermonuclear fusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>But that certainly won't make us give up on the artificial sun dream the day for
                            thermonuclear may come when we start to colonize exoplanets around other stars after all
                            they'll definitely be water which is the source of thermonuclear fuel, so the main thing for
                            humanity is not to screw everything up right now. </p>
