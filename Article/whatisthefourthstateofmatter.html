                        <strong>What is The Fourth State of Matter?
                        </strong>
                        <p>Most people  knows about only the three states of matter:-
                          <p>  1.Solid</p>
                          <p> 2.Liquid</p> 
                          <p> 3.Gas</p> 
                            Every one knows that the atmosphere is GAS, the ocean is LIQUID, and the ground we 
                            are standing on is solid. These are the three states of matter that  ever
                             exist and the difference among these forms is the level of  energy existing in 
                             them but that's not all! there is another state of matter which is known as the 
                             fourth state of matter, that's Plasma. 
                            

                        </p>

                      
                        <h1>How it Comes?
                        </h1>
                        <p>Well in a nutshell, you have ice cube as solid if we heat it up - the ice cube will melt and dissolve into liquid.
                             Continue to heat it up, the liquid will slowly evaporate, transforing into gas.
                              So, what if we continue to provide heat into this gas? Well! when temperature reaches several thousand degrees, then this gas will be ionized. 
                              The vast majority of the molecule or atom are left with only nucleus since the electrons have separated
                               and moved independently.</p>
                           <p>This ionized  gas is a mixture of electrons, neutral molecules, and positively and negatively charged 
                            ions which move chaotically. And there you have PLASMA.</p> 
                            <p>PLASMA is the first state of matter in the universe because 99.9% of all visible
                                 matter in the univese exists in the state of plasma. The sun is a giant plasma;
                                  stars are also luminious sphere of plasma. The lightning that strikes during
                                   thunderstorm, or the magical phenomenon of the aurora borealis, are also
                                    PLASMA. Only on Earth or some dark planets in the galaxy, can you find
                                     sustances that exist in 3 states of Solid, Liquid & Gas which accounts for 
                                     only 0.1%. Therefore, Plasma is the most powerful "substance"  in the
                                      univers. Plasma's application in our daily life is very diverse such 
                                      as plasma lights, plasma screens, or plasma cutters used in mechanical
                                       factories. Especially, a 14 billion USD NETR arc reactor in France can
                                        produce plasma with up to 150 million degrees Celcius. Speaking of 
                                        arc reactors, we have to mention Tony Stark's aka Iron man mini type
                                         arc reactor on his chest. This small "reactor", which is only a few 
                                         pound, can produce huge source of energy. This energy converts 
                                         directly into electricity helping Iron Man fly up in the air or blast
                                          power to save the world.</p>
                         <p>  George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, did not really fool you with his science
                             fiction. Do you remember the colourful Lightsaber?
                            If you remember then yes, it is also Plasma due to the control of the magnetic
                             field located in the hilt, the arc light has a fixed shape.</p> 
                            <p>  Is it possible to
                              make arc light in real life? The answer is yes, it is possibe if you want to
                               know how then I will give the video link just down below
