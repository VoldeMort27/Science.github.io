                        <strong>Something Unusual is Going On With Proxima B Right Now 
                        </strong>
                        <p>In 2016 the european southern observatory reported finding an exoplanet that 
                            appaers to be the closest to us proxima centauri B or proxima B for short
                             it is loacted in the havitable zone of the star proxima centuri this means 
                             that there could be life on it and If earth suddenly finds itself on the 
                             brink of destruction this exoplanet could become one of he best places to
                              move to moreover flying there would take just a little more than four light
                               years  which is close by space standards but for our current technologies
                                this distance is really huge.

                        </p>
                        <p>In This blog you'll find out how far have people gone into space what engine
                             will make a spaceship fly 600 times faster than lightning and when will our 
                             spacecraft be able to reach the new earth.

                        <strong>Why Do We Need To Explore Proxima B Asap?

                        </strong>
                        <p>Why is it necessary to fly to proxima b as fast as possible?

                        </p>
                        <p>This is the centrist constellatioon in the southern sky as the  knee of its 
                            front leg there's the triple star system alpha centauri proxima centauri is
                             the smallest and closest to us  right at this moment it's moving along its
                              huge orbit towards earth at a speed of 22 kilometers pre second this is 3 
                              times faster than the space shuttle moves now we have the perfect
                               opportunity to explore this promising exoplanet because after this phase 
                               of the approach it'll move 700 million  kilometres further away from us
                                every year that's almost the distance from  the sun to jupiter if we're 
                                too late potential colonization will be delayed by centuries or could 
                                become impossible altogether proxima centauri is a red dwarf compared to 
                                our sun its deameter is 7 times smaller it's also 8 times lighter and its
                                 temperature half that of our sun looks relatively  modest but you could 
                                 settle down nearby besides proxima b is 20 times closer to its star than
                                  earth is to our sun this proximity might lead to one side of the
                                   exoplanet being turned towards its star just like the moon is to the
                                    earth that's why half the planet might be hot and the other half icy 
                                    however some scientists don't see this as a problem after all if 
                                    proxima b has an atmosphere and oceans they could ease extreme 
                                    temperature changes given that this exoplanet is more massive than 
                                    earth it could hold both air and water an unpleasent surprise waiting
                                     for us is proxima centauri's rage outbrusts a red dwarf can suddenly 
                                     become a thousand times brighter from time to time and if this 
                                     happend it would genorously irradiate proxima b so both local life
                                      and colonists from earth would have to take refuge on the planet's 
                                      dark side but to finally understand whether proxima b is suitable 
                                      for life or not we need to check it in advance before it starts
                                       moving away from us and considering the potential of contemporary 
                                       spacecraft that's a rather big problem.

                        <strong>Why can't Modern Spacecraft Get to Proxima B Quickly?

                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            Why would existing spacecraft spend ages flying to proxima b to convey the scale of this task?

</p>
        <p>Let's put aside kilometers and get out our space tape measure one astronomical unit or au is
             the distance from the sun to the earth that's around 150 million kilometers and there are 
             only five terrestrial spaceaircraft that have ever flown 10 times greater distances in space 
             the new horizons probe was launched in 2006 with a speed of 15 kilometers per second it's 
             already managed to explore pluto and its moons at this moment the probe is moved away from 
             the sun by roughly 50 astronomical units. At the same time the twin probes pioneer 10 and 11 
             which launched by NASA in the early 70s in their turn have achieved over 120 and 100 
             astronomical units the vouager 1 and voyager 2 probes launched in the late 70s can be 
             called record holder, In this space marathon voyager 2 has already flown over 122 astronomica
             l units while its twin brothers set flight distance record over 147 astronomical units and
              that's what the distance from earth to proxima b looks like compared to the achievements of 
              our probes and if the most advanced voyager 1 decided to fly to proxima b it would have to 
              overcome a distance 1800 times greater and it would take almost 74,000 years to get there 
              faster we'd have to load our probe with fuel tanks to speed it up which means there would be
               no room for scientific equipmet and the meaning of the mission would be lost so we need new 
               engineering solutions.
