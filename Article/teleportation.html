                        <strong>What do We Know About Teleportation?
                        </strong>
                        <p>We have seen the heroes of science fiction films and computer games easily dissolve
                             in the air materlizing in different parts of the universe but in real life this
                              is not possible or is it? In fact scientists have been actively working in this
                               direction for more than 20 years achieving amazing results.

                        </p>

                        <strong> How close are we to creating a teleporter?

                        </strong>
                        <p>Teleportation it means the instantaneous movement of objects at any distance 
                            ideally faster then the speed of light the word itself was invented in 1931 by 
                            the American publicist charles forte who combined the greek word (TELE that is far
                             away) and (the root of the latin verb PORTER meaning to carry) in his book
                              volcanoes of the sky he used this term for the inexplicable movements of objects
                               in space fourth book had no scientific basis it was a collection of stories
                                legends and myths about teleportation such transportation through space have
                                 indeed been talked about at all times unthinkable stories about teleportation 
                                 sometimes pop up in the press.</p>
                                 <p>    The American destroyer eldridge for example in 1943 it allegadly 
                                    traveled 320 km from Norfolk to Philadelphia in an instant scientists were
                                     shocked and began to find out all the circumstances of this unique event
                                      however, it turned out that the ship simply quickly sailed the distance
                                       between the cities along the canal.</p>
                       <p>    But to some scientists teleportation no longer seems like something out of
                            science fiction movie. They've learned all possible methods of instantaneous
                             movement and even managed to master some of them what kind of teleports does 
                             science does science suggests.

                        <strong>Teleport of Holes and voids

                        </strong>
                        <p>Do you like the idea of suddenly finding yourself on the other side of 
                            the world through a gap in space time and the teleport for this is already 
                            in your house right now just you don't see it . But don't think that getting 
                            through it will be as easy to getting into a neighbor's yard through a gap in
                             the fence according to one of the scientific hypotheses our world is full of 
                             microscopic holes after all atoms are in constant motion and voids appear between
                              them such a whole a dozen atoms wide maximum would be needed to expand somehow
                               to the size of a person for someone to teleport through it you will also need 
                               to hold the hole empty so that it's not quickly filled with particles probably
                                exotic matter with a negative charge would be suitable for this it just hasn't 
                                been found yet scientists have suggested that some stars are giant clumbs of
                                 exotic matter however this theory has not been supported by research. 
                                 Theoretically you could slip into the smallest gap in space becoming a 
                                 quantum wave in quantum machanics such waves are bounded by any micro 
                                 particle but it's not known how to make wave out of a person in practice 
                                 and then materialize them again

                        <strong> Teleport through a Wormhole 


                        </strong>
                        <p>Wormholes can also become teleports scientists suggests that our 3-dimensional 
                            universe is bent in the fourth dimension in some places. In these bends there are 
                            tunnels wormholes this is where two points in space may have large distance between 
                            them in the third dimension but in the fourth they're are almost in the same location. 
                        </p>
                                 <p>   This is easy to imagine by folding a sheet of paper so that its two
                                    distant points touch poke this piece with a pen and you get a model of a
                                     wormhole there is an opinion in the scientific world that wormhoels hide
                                      in black holes but you can't get inside the black hole an accretion
                                       disk of gas rotates around each of these monsters with icredible speed
                                        it will immediately stretch you like spaghetti and if you slip through 
                                        the disk you'll die from the crushing gravity of the black hole. 
                                        If you somehow nevertheless fall into a wormhole it will surely 
                                        destroy you instantly wormholes are only open for a second then they 
                                        close so the passage will have to be held in place this is where the
                                         exotic mata would fit again but we don't have it.

                        <strong>Possible Probability Teleport

                        </strong>
                        <p>One day you might find yourself in an unknown place open the door to the bedroom 
                            and you'll find yourself on a distant planet not expecting that at all and all 
                            because of the quantum instability of the electrons in your body which randomly
                             move around the universe. However, you should not be afraid the probability of 
                             spontaneous movement is practically 0.  The time when one such event occurs 
                             exceeds the age of the universe but the wave functions of the atoms of our 
                             body nevertheless reach other planets if you study and take control of their 
                             movement then theoretically you can teleport people this method is shown in 
                             the douglas adams  film the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy whether this can 
                             be produced in real life scientists do not know yet.
