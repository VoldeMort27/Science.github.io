                        <strong>How Fast Will We Improve?
                        </strong>
                        <p>How soon canwe get new engines for interstellar flights luckily for us scientists have long been trying to solve problems with probe fuel that's why they experiment with a lot of alternative energy sources but will they have enough time to create a new fuel-powered engine while proxima b is still moving towards earth Jim Woodward and Hal Fearne physicists from california are developing something called the mega drive which applies mox principal sounds like a voodoo spell but they hope this project will open the ear of interstellar space travel. The mega drive creates vibrations and moves them in the needed direction with the help of electricity and a stack of crystals it's kind of like shaking on skates from the cold directing your shiver forward so that its power pulls you towards a glass of hot mulled wine sounds increadible but it must be very economial in practice NASA has already provided money for development but everything remains just at the level of theory so far and you can't get very far and you can't get very far with that British engineer Roger Shoyer went even further and came up with the EMDrive engine which was immediately nicknamed the impossible drive it consists of a magnetron that reflects microwaves just like in your ordinary microwave oven. They get trapped in a cone-shaped thing and generate a powerful thrust that's an eco-friendly idea functioning on electricity alone unfortunately it's not possible yet to say when exactly the 1st prototype will start working which kind of justfies its nickname to conquer proxima b. We need something more reliable and the thermonuclear engine project is showing outstanding result it's being modeled at the princeton plasma physics laboratory this engine will run on the nuclear fusion energy of helium-3 and deuterium.

                        </p>
                        <p>Spacecraft was such an engine could make it to pluto in just 5 years that's twice as fast as the new horizons probe and in 42,000 years it would be able to reach proxima b not that bad but unfortunately our window of opportunity will slamed shut by that time according to astronomers claculations proxima centauri and its exoplanet will being to rapidly move away from us in  their orbits in 27,000 years and so far there's only 1 technology that has a chance to deliver probes there in time.

                        <strong>What is the Fastest Way to Reach Proxima B?

                        </strong>
                        <p>What do spacecraft capable of quickly flying to proxima b looks like.

                        </p>
                        <p>If we want to study the nearest star system not in thousands of years but in the coming decades the probe will need to speed up to 1/5 the speed of light that's 60,000 kilometers per second. 

                        </p>
                        <p>It's like circling the earth one and a half times every second yeah that's pretty fast so far only the breakthrough starshot project could hypthetically do that the idea is based on the fact that ordinary photons have impules and can push objects they bump into in a nutshell. If you put a solar sail in space the light of our star or a leaser will make it fly first a normal rocket will lift a 1000 probes into earth's orbit each weighing just 1 gram that's lighter than a chip each probe will have a solar sail four by four meters in size a hundred nanometers thick and weighing another half a chip when the sails are installed a 100 gigawatt earth-based laser system will fire at them for 10 minutes and this is enough for a fleet of microprobes to start flying at the very same one-fifth the speed of light and that is 600 times faster than lightning at this speed a collision with even a speck of dust will destroy the sail those probes that would survive and reach proxima b only 20 years later must do another trick that even the superhero flash would  envy they'll only have a mere moment to take a photo of the exoplanet is there's only one chance.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main thing I suppose is not to forget to remove the lens cap after that the 
                            photos will be transmitted to earth which would take about 5 more years to 
                            reach us today engineers are striving for the launch of starshop with all 
                            their might so that here in this 21st century we can finally say mission 
                            accompalished that we've reached another star for the first time in history.
                             But what will we see in the forthcoming images from proxima b oceans and 
                             earth-like atmosphere or scorched deserts.
                        </p>
                        <p>If proxima beat turns out not to be suitable for life it's not the biggest deal
                             in the alpha centauri binary system both stars have their own exoplanets and 
                             from a base on proxima centauri they'll be within reach so we know indeed 
                             we'll find something intresting somewhere in the vicinity of centrist left 
                             knee.
